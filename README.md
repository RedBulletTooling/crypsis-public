This project has been created and developed by Matthijs Vogel and Luc Pluimakers.

# Contents of repo
This repo contains, all files from hardware to software, production files and all to recreate Crypsis
We of course created very detailed documentation. This can be found on our gitbook link here: https://redbullettooling.gitbook.io/keyvilboard-apt/

# Motivation
We do hate nothing more than the knowledge that has gone to waste. This product might have never been commercially viable as we had hoped. But we have put time, effort and a decent chunk of money into this project to create something that hasn't been replicated since. Our goal with publiciying this project is that goal of it's creation will be reached. To prevent harms to those who can't protect themselfs. May that be terrorism, child explotation or other haneos crimes. If you work for one of these organisations and have a need, contact us. We are happy to share.

# What is crypsis
Crypsis simply is a hardware keylogger that communicates using a NFR9160 module. By doing so we can do very advanced methods of communicating covertly, aswell as propper implementation of encryption and other security measures. Appart from the hardware the server [ what can server do]
